# GROUP BY LECTURE

# The "group by" clause is used to aggregate a table into various groups of shared characteristics.
#
# Grouping data is often accompanied with the use of aggregate functions to derive additional information
# about the various groupings.
#
# Most common aggregate functions are:
#
#     MIN()
#     MAX()
#     SUM()
#     AVG()
#     COUNT()
#
# One or multiple columns may be grouped together.
#
# No table columns may exist in a select clause that are not contained in the group by clause.
#
#     The group by clause is after an optional where clause and before an optional order by clause.
#
#     The order of a result set may be by an aggregate column but an aggregate column cannot be referenced in a where clause.
#
# A having clause is a way to use aggregate results as if in a where clause.
